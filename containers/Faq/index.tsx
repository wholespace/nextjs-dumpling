          Purchasing a firearm in California requires you to jump through
          endless hoops, ensuring you remain compliant with the state's strict
          laws. Firearm dealers and shops can also be quite off-putting and
          callous, especially for a first-timer. In some cases, dealers may push
          a specific firearm on a person just for the sake of a sale, even if
          the product is not the best fit for the gun owner. We move most of the
          purchasing process online, so you do not have to commit to multiple
          trips to the firearm dealer. Shoppers may ask our specialists
          questions via live chat so they can make an informed decision when
          deciding on a firearm. There's no pressure added, and we encourage
          shoppers to purchase a gun that best suits them.
