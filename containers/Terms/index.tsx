In the event ULTRALYTICS experiences an increase in cost as a result of changes in the pricing assumptions, whether they be based on design changes by customer, process changes necessary to successfully manufacture product as approved by CUSTOMER, or changes to any pricing assumption in the quote, ULTRALYTICS shall be entitled to the Price adjustment set forth in Section 6.1.2.4 Product Ordering.

In addition, CUSTOMER acknowledges that there is a lag time between any Customer cancellation and the cancellation of the Components required to support production.(d) Reschedule. CUSTOMER may not reschedule all or part of a scheduled without prior written approval from ULTRALYTICS.

Specifically, CUSTOMER’s Component Liability shall be equal to ULTRALYTICS’s Delivered Cost of all Components ordered in support of any Order, including any excess Components resulting from any minimum buy quantities, tape and reel quantities, and multiples of packaging quantities required by the Vendor less the actual cost (per the bill of materials) of those Components which are returnable to Vendor (less any cancellation or restocking charges). At CUSTOMER’S request, ULTRALYTICS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize CUSTOMER’S Component Liability by attempting to return Components to the Vendor; provided, however, that ULTRALYTICS shall not be obligated to attempt to return to Vendor Components which are, in the aggregate, worth less than $100.00.(f) Any obsolescence of manufactured or work-in-progress inventory, or components of product, in possession of ULTRALYTICS at the time of a change (as documented in Section 6) shall be the financial liability of CUSTOMER, in accordance with Section 4.1(e) and Section 6.1.4.3 Amortized NRE Costs. If the Quote includes one or more line items indicating the amortization of Non-Recurring Expenses (NRE), then it is expected that these NRE payments will be made on the original production schedule dates. If CUSTOMER re-schedules production in accordance with Section 4.2(d), ULTRALYTICS will have, at its discretion, the right to request that the amortized NRE payments be made on the original schedule. ULTRALYTICS’s waiving of this right during any schedule change does not preclude its right to do so during any future rescheduling of delivery or guarantee and future waiving of such collection rights.",
